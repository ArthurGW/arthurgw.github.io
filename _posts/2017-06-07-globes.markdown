Here are some ideas for globes, in various styles and prices.  They are not necessarily the one we would choose of each style, just an overview of what's out there.  Some of them will even get there in time if I order them very soon...  I am happy to pay on our UK credit card and sort out payment at some future point.

I can't find a magnetic globe in the UK.  I quite like the cork one actually.  I have included a magnetic map, which is obviously practical but probably not the right gift given Mum's stated wish.

If people could get back to me asap that would be good!

[Cork globe][1]
[Copper-stand floor globe][2]
[More modern-style floor globe][3]
[Modern stylish desk globe][4]
[Slightly less modern, 50s style?][5]
[Hexagonal base][6]
[2nd-hand vintage French globe, slightly worn (circa 1950, shipped from France)][7]
[Art deco globe, 1920s map][8]
[Any of a number of Replogle vintage-style globes, all quite similar, e.g. this one][9]
[Magnetic map][10]
[Big library globe (Jo)][11]
[Magnetic globe (Henry, US)][12]
